# Repogenesis - Healthcare Track

Welcome to the **Healthcare Track** of Repogenesis!  
This repository sets the foundation for teams building applications in health, wellness, diagnostics, medical data, and healthcare technology.

Participants will **fork this repository**, create a folder with their **team name**, and build their project inside it.

## What Is Healthcare Tech?

You can build solutions such as:

- Patient vitals monitoring
- Health dashboards
- Appointment/clinic systems
- Fitness & wellness apps
- Symptom analysis tools
- Mental health assistants
- Medical record management
- Predictive analytics
- AI-based diagnostics (on dummy data)
- Telemedicine utilities
- Emergency assistance systems

Healthcare is vast - explore subdomains freely.

## Ethics & Privacy Guidelines

Healthcare is a sensitive domain. Please follow:

- Do **not** use real patient data. **Only fictional or anonymized datasets**.
- Respect medical ethics.
- Be cautious when using ML for predictions.
- Do not claim clinical accuracy - this is a student innovation event.
- Ensure your app does not give harmful medical recommendations.

## Resources Included

In the `docs/` and `starter/` folders, you will find:

- Dummy health datasets
- FHIR (Healthcare data standard) examples
- Basic dashboard starter
- Example vitals JSON
- Recommended tools & libraries
